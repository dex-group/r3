The integration of all of the experiences obtained abroad is what shaped the idea of AquÃ­ Studio. Physically attained to a geographical location but deliberately, and mindfully, free to adopt new ideologies, praxis, languages and colorful projects. Her main objective being the creation of aesthetic and functional solution for the required services and, of course, (always)open-mindedness.
