{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>Change Themes</h2>\n<p>Typora has 5~6 built-in themes. Changing writing theme can be done by selecting theme under the <code>theme</code> menu bar. You could also download, install, modify or write your own custom theme to stylize Typora.</p>\n<p>Typora use CSS to stylish all contents, each theme under <code>theme</code> menu is one <code>.css</code> files under \"typora's theme folder\". So, briefly speaking, you could add/modify themes by adding/modifying correspond css files under \"typora's theme folder\".</p>\n<h2>Get Typora Themes</h2>\n<p>We have an office website <a href=\"http://theme.typora.io\">Typora Theme Gallery</a> for designers/developers to share their custom themes with others. You could download theme from there.</p>\n<h2>Install Custom Themes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Open Theme Folder. (see instructions below)</li>\n<li>Copy or move <code>.css</code> file and related resources, like fonts or images, into the newly opened folder.</li>\n<li>Restart typora, then select it from <code>Themes</code> menu.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Open Theme Folder</h2>\n<h3>macOS</h3>\n<p>Open preference panel by <code>cmd+`</code>, then click \"Open Theme Folder\"</p>\n<img src=\"img/Snip20160921_1.png\" style=\"zoom:50%\" />\n<h3>Windows/Linux</h3>\n<p>Open preference panel from <code>File</code> → <code>Preference</code> from menubar, then click \"Open Theme Folder\":</p>\n<img src=\"img/Snip20160921_2.png\" style=\"zoom:50%\" />\n<h2>Modify Current Styles</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, you may just want to change font family for all themes, for change font-color for headings for a specific themes. In this case, you do not need to copy/modify a whole exiting css file, just <a href=\"http://support.typora.io/Add-Custom-CSS/\">Add Custom CSS</a> is enough. In brief:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create &#x26; write a <code>base.user.css</code> under theme folder, the css rules inside it will be applied to all themes.</li>\n<li>Create &#x26; write a <code>{theme-css-name}.user.css</code> under theme folder, the css rules inside it will only be applied to theme file <code>{theme-css-name}.css</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that the built-in CSS theme files will get overwritten completely on typora version up, so, write your custom css into <code>*.user.css</code>, instead of the existing files, will prevent your modifications from being lost after update.</p>\n<h2>Write My Own Theme</h2>\n<p>Please refer to <a href=\"http://theme.typora.io/doc/Write-Custom-Theme/\">Write Custom Theme for Typora</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2018","path":"/blog/themes","title":"Custom Themes"}}},"pageContext":{"prev":null,"next":{"excerpt":"Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and\nConsonantia, there live the blind texts.
